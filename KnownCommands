I can use all of the following commands even though I might not be able to use them to their whole extend.. I often look things up when I do not know how to use them.

Linux:
* cat <file or text>
-> prints the content of the file or the text in the console

* man <tool>
-> opens the manual for a tool (control with 'h', 'j', 'k' and 'l')

* whoami
-> displays current username

* id
-> returns user identity

* uname <options>
-> information about the operating system

* pwd
-> current directory you are in

* who
-> currently logged in user

* ls <options>
-> lists a directories content (standard is the current directory)

* cd <path>
-> changes the directory to the path (if valid)

* clear
-> clears the terminal

* touch <name>
-> creates an empty file with name

* mkdir <options> <name>
-> creates a whole directory

* tree <options> <name>
-> Lists the content of a whole directory recursively

* mv <options> <name>
-> move or rename files or directories
