This file is about random commands I have been using...

locate *.bat    -> Locate paths to all .bat files
locate *.bat -c  -> Count of all .bat files
find /etc/ -name shadow  -> Finds all files in /etc/ named shadow
find /etc/ -name shadow 2>/dev/null -> Same as above, but errors are not visible since they go into /dev/null
find /etc/ -name shadow 2> stderr.txt 1> stdout.txt
cat < stdout.txt
find /etc/ -name passwd >> stdout.txt 2>/dev/null
find -name *.log | wc -l        -> count the files
find -name *.log | grep systemd | wc -l      -> difference is, path has to include systemd
